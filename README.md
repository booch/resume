Hi
==

Thanks for taking a look at my résumé.
You're probably here to grab a copy in one of these formats:

* [HTML](https://booch.github.io/resume/resume.html)
* [PDF](https://booch.github.io/resume/resume.pdf)
* [text](https://booch.github.io/resume/resume.txt)

-- Craig Buchek


Why
---

I need to provide my résumé in several formats, because different companies
have different requirements.

After several years of manually updating 3 different formats, I decided to
maintain and update only a Markdown version, and generate all the other
formats from that. I tried using MultiMarkdown at first, then used Pandoc
for a while. I'm now using Kramdown for HTML generation, and wkhtmltopdf to
generate PDFs.

Having my résumé in git will also help me track changes over time. And
it will give me the possibility of "forking" my résumé for different
purposes.


TODO
----

Try a Markdown-to-text processor to create the text version:
- mdcat
- glow
- [tty-markdown](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-markdown)
